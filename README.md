“CAPACITATED, OPTIMAL, GUIDED VEHICLE ROUTING with SOFT FENCING

It is one of the most challenging combinatorial optimization tasks. The interest in VRP is motivated by its practical relevance as well as by its considerable difficulty.

Explanation of the Keywords used in the Title :
As the problem definition is mainly related to truck which is filled to its
capacity in an optimal way the word CAPACITATED is used. The main criteria of
the problem is to deliver the goods ordered by multiple clients to them so
that the distance covered in delivering those goods to the clients is minimal
along with the vehicle or truck tracking facility using geo-fencing on a Google
map in an android device hence the word OPTIMAL.Our program will display the map
using Google map API‘s hence the word GUIDED. The location of driver is noted
using the GPS tracker of his mobile, the location of driver is constantly
monitored to check if the truck is deviating from the assigned path,
as we are virtually defining a boundary the word FENCING has been used.
